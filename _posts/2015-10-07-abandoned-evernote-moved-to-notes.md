I've been using Evernote casually for years. Though it's not a quite
full-featured app, and has almost added no (big) features through years, I was
still using it because it's fine for my needs.

Recently, it adopted a unwise strategy, that popping a dialog to ask you to
upgrade to a premium account every so often. By "unwise", I mean it only drives
people away. I'm one of them, and now OS X El Capitan greatly improves its
Notes app, so I want to try to use Notes for notes.

I wrote
[a simple AppleScript](https://gist.github.com/wwwjfy/f3255801888a5cf01829)
to move all notes from Evernote to Notes. This just creates folder if it
doesn't already exists, and create a note by Evernote's HTML content, without
attachments.

Notes does not handle web clips or PDFs, indeed. But it might be enough for
casual usage. I'll keep Evernote closed for now.
