I watch movies from iTunes more and more. One of the problems is that
sometimes I do want to have subtitle of Simplified Chinese, so I don't
have to use my poor English, though most of recent movies come with
subtitle of English. Well, I couldn't find an app to do that, so I
wrote one.

[Subtle Subtitle](https://github.com/wwwjfy/Subtle-Subtitle/) is a very
rough version now, but usable, at least for me. I don't have big plan
for it, just improve it when using, or any good ideas come.

[Try it](https://github.com/wwwjfy/Subtle-Subtitle/releases/)
if you're interested.
