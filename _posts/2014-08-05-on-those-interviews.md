## Background ##

By June 2014, it had been 2 years since I resignated from my first company.

Several months later, I started working on a startup of a friend for about one
year. It was like a part-time job, that I worked half a day.

After that, I was idle at home. I read novels, and technical books, wrote
interesting code, went to library once in a while, and even cooked sometimes.
That was fun.

The thing was I was not under pressure, so it was no push for me to learn more,
and become better. Self-discipline was not working for me well. And then, I
realized I need to get to work. It was my first time to job-hunt as an
experienced developer, not like a just-graduate freshman.

## Problem ##

So I applied jobs on several different companies which I like, and got a few
chances of interviews.

In the interviews, I was asked technical questions. Some were things I know, and
others I didn't. That is a good way to know what I'm lack of. I met some good
interviewers, who digged things up. I thought I knew things well, while in fact
I didn't. Lacking of practice makes me mistake shallow understanding for a
better one. Though some are not used often on daily work, it shows the ability
and the enthusiasm to know more. Unfortunately, I failed some.

## Reason ##

Part of the reason, I guess, is the arrogance. In the old company, I did a bit
better than majority, which got me overvalued praise. It made me spend more time
having fun, and less time improving. And I thought I was pretty good, which is
not true.

Another reason is, though I've been interested in low-level programming, and how
things work, I haven't got chances to learn and apply. Nowadays, with all these
flashy technologies, and so many _interesting_ libraries and frameworks have
been appearing every single day, I've been kinda lost in the distractions.

## Outcome ##

I end up working in a startup introduced by a colleague. I'm not 100% satisfied,
but I'm gonna hang in there, working, learning, getting better. The good thing
is, I do learn a lot from those interviews, and I know the weakness of myself,
and I have the motives.
