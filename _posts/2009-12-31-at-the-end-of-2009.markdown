It's a long time from the last post. :) How time flies, it's the last day of 2009.

I spent almost all the time in Exoweb, except one month at school for my graduation project.

I began to study and work at Exoweb on 15th, Dec, 2008. I graduated this year, and I learned many kinds of knowledge about Software Development and Linux; I made friends with nice guys and learned a lot from them; I saw new guys coming and saw some friends off; I joined in exciting parties; I watched nice films and bad ones as well. Wow, it's quite a good year to begin my postgraduate life.

I'm eager to try new stuffs in the coming brand new 2010. As 2012 is approaching. :-D

Hope all my friends happier in 2010. :)
