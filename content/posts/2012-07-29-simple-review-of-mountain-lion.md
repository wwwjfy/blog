I got the Mountain Lion as soon as I can and have it installed on my new Macbook Air.
(Well, I have to blame Apple's performance of sending redeem codes, which seemed to be confirmed and sent by manual. This took about 35 hours for me to get it.)

This is a simple review after 2-day usage. I call it simple, compared to some 24-page review. :)

## Functionalities

Though there are a bunch of new features coming with Mountain Lion, I found there are almost nothing exciting for me.

### Major Features

  - Notification Center: I've already got Growl and it's working fine.

  - Reminder: Calendar(formly known as iCal) does the same work.

  - Notes: Evernote are better.

  - Game Center: I rarely play games on Mac, and I doubt how many games support that now.

  - iCloud: I've got only one Mac. Maybe it's unfair that many got a few Macs, but for me, it's useless.

  - Messages: ASAIK, none of my friends use that.

  - Share/Twitter: I'm a reader more than a sharer.

### Other improvements

There are some things should be done at the first version they appear in Lion:

  - Fullscreen on non-main display: Of course. I recall the embrassing moments I fullscreened the slides and they appeared on my laptop, instead of external big screen.

  - Search on Launchpad: Definitely there should be the search feature. But I'm already not using that which takes a lot of time to find the app. I'm using Alfred which is amazing to have the job done.

There are also bad changes from my view:

  - Dashboard: Seriously, the old one is better.

  - Notification Center icon: I don't like the icon on right-top. There should at least be an option to remove it. I want to keep my Menubar as simple with only necessary icons.

  - OS X software updates: I don't know if it's a good change but I didn't feel right at the first glance.

  - Safari 

    - It's said to be faster, but I'm not aware of that yet.

    - "Show All Tabs": Seriously, Apple? I don't think everything in iOS can be merged to Mac OS X (OK, it's called OS X now). This is totally useless. There are so many ways to navigate through all tabs.

Some improvements are good and friendly, like inline progress for downloads in Finder, and Power Nap.

I would hope there is a "Disable Sharing" option for me, non-sharing people.

## Problems

By far, I've met two problems:

  - The desktop number in Mission Control is not matched with the real one, as the order changed by usage frequency. It's always 1,2,3,... while the actual order may be 1,3,2,...

  - Dashboard freezes all windows (Mission Control still works) until I kill DashboardClient processes sshed from another machine.

## Conclusion

Mountain Lion is OK overall, with many minor improvements and some bugs, while the major features are not my things. This update is about iCloud and sharing. I'll give a 4 out of 5. Hmm, it seems I prefer Lion. But well, things move on. Let me hope Apple can fix the problems and work on exciting features.
