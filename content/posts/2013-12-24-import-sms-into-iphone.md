I bought my very first iPhone several weeks ago, though I had my first iOS
device about four years ago.

It's a iPhone 5s and everything works well. Except that I want my old SMSes
there. I found some backup scripts and
[one import program in C#](https://github.com/erikvdv1/iphone-message-import),
which seems outdated. (I found it updated for iOS 7 later, anyway, C# is not
easy for me to install and use and tweak on Mac.)

That's when I wanted to write one in python.
[Here it is](https://github.com/wwwjfy/iPhoneSMSBackupRestore).

It's not complete, but it's usable, and useful I believe.
That's one of my problems, and I believe true for quite some people,
that when I get something work, I lose most of the interest,
to make it complete or perfect.
